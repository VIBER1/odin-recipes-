      <p>
        Naan is a leavened flatbread made in some countries in Asia. 
        These breads are baked in a tandoor (a cylindrical oven made of clay). 
        It is also popular in India and is served in almost all the restaurants here.</p>
        
       <p> Though naan is not made in Indian homes as a staple. It is roti or chapati 
        (unleavened flatbread made from whole wheat flour) that is made on a regular basis.</p>

       <p> For the leavening of naan dough, yeast is used or a mixture of curd+baking powder is used. 
        This recipe includes baking powder and curd for the leavening.</p>
        
       <p> Naan is such a delish bread that it makes you forget about all-purpose flour.  
        I do make whole wheat naan, but sometimes the family wants soft textured naan 
        made with all-purpose flour, the way they are made in restaurants. 
        So I combine both whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour to make naan – 
        like in this recipe of Garlic Naan.</p>
        
        <p>Whenever we go to a restaurant then most of the time we end up ordering naan with 
        a curry or lentil-based dish. Knowing very well that it will be probably made with 
        all-purpose flour and not good for health.</p>
        
        <p>But what to do! These flat breads tastes so well with curries that you end up 
        loosening your guard about eating healthy food. Once in a while we all like to relax 
        our guard and relish fried food or other supposed to be unhealthy food.</p>
        
       <h3> What is Naan Bread?</h3>
        <p>Both naan and naan bread are the same. In Asia, we call these delicious bread as 
        naan and in the United States, these are called as naan bread.</p>
        
        
        <p>Preferably naan bread should be eaten hot for best taste and texture. 
        As once it cools down then it becomes dense, hard and loses its taste. 
        At least the restaurant ones become like that. Not this recipe. 
        The naan bread remains soft and slightly chewy even when they become warm or cool.</p>
        
       <h3> Naan Recipe Variations</h3>
        There are many ways a basic naan recipe can be modified to suit your tastes.
        <ol>     
            <li>Whole wheat flour – in this recipe post, I have used all-purpose flour to make them. 
                You can even use whole wheat flour or a combination of whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour. 
                Sometimes I make this naan bread with a 2:1 proportion of whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour,
                 but you can use 1:1 or even 3:1 of whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour respectively.
                 If you are very conscious about eating whole wheat flour naan only, then you can check this 
                 Butter Naan recipe made with whole wheat flour.</li> 
        
        
        
        <li>Herbs and spices – to make the naan more flavorful, you can add one to 
        two herbs or a mix of herbs in the dough. Herbs like mint, cilantro, parsley, 
        basil etc add some color as well as flavor. Some spices or ground spice powders 
        like red chili powder, black pepper powder or chaat masala powder will also make naan 
        taste more better. E.g. Garlic flavored naan is also popular.</li>
