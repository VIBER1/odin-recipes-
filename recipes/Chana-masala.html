         <strong>Chana Masala</strong>
          is a popular Indian dish of white chickpeas in a 
         spicy and tangy gravy. In North India, this dish is called 
         ‘chole masala,’ or simply ‘chole’. No matter what you call it, 
         this is a tasty vegetarian curry dish that you should definitely 
         try making yourself!</p>
         <p>Chana is the Hindi word and chole is the Punjabi word for chickpeas. 
         In Hindi, the word masala means a mixture of spices. When the word 
         masala shows up in a dish – like this Chana Masala or Paneer Butter 
         Masala, for example – it specifically refers to a spiced gravy.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step1</h3>
        <p>
            Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food processor into a paste.
        </p>

        <h3> Step 2</h3>
        <p>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot oil until fragrant, 
            about 30 seconds. Pour the paste into the skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate 
            from the mixture and is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili powder, 
            coriander, powder, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes
        </p>
        <h3>Step3</h3>
        <p>
            Stir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil and stir chickpeas into the gravy. 
            Reduce heat to medium and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
