         <strong>Shahi Paneer</strong>
        a classical and premium north indian or punjabi curry
         made with paneer in dry fruit sauce. unlike other traditional
          paneer based curries, this curry is more creamy and sweet in 
          taste due to the use of dry fruits. it is an ideal gravy based
           curry which can be easily served with choice of roti’s, bread 
           and also with rice options.

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3> Step 1</h3>
        <p>
            Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the 
            onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft
           and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cumin, coriander
           turmeric, and chili powder over the onion and garlic; continue 
           cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds.
        </p>
        <h3>Step2</h3>
        <p>
            Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; cook until the 
            excess liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes.
             Add the paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the mixture; stir 
             gently so the paneer does not break apart. Cook until the paneer 
             begins to absorb some of the liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir the 
             cream into the mixture and simmer another 5 minutes. Garnish with
              cilantro to serve.
